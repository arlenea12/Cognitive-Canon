For most persons with schizophrenia, delusions are present. </li>
<li> Hallucinations. Usually, these include perceiving or hearing unreal phenomena. Nonetheless, a person suffering from schizophrenia experiences all the intensity and consequences of a typical event. </li> 
<li> Disordered speech or thought. chaotic speech suggests chaotic thought. Questions may not be fully or partially addressed, and effective communication may be compromised. On rare occasions, speech may consist of stringing together unintelligible words, a phenomenon frequently referred to as "word salad." </li>
<li> Aberrant or very disordered motor behavior. This might manifest itself in a variety of ways, ranging from erratic excitement to childish foolishness. The lack of goal-focused behavior makes activities difficult to complete. A person's behavior may include defying orders, adopting an odd or improper posture, being completely unresponsive, or moving excessively and uselessly. </li>
<li> Adverse signs. This is diminished or not able to perform normally. For instance, the individual might speak monotonously, avoid making eye contact, or exhibit signs of lack of emotion by changing their facial expressions or personal cleanliness. </li>
<li> In addition, the person can stop enjoying routine tasks, withdraw socially, or be incapable of enjoying themselves. </li> </ul>
